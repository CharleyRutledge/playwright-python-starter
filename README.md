# Playwright Python Starter

A lightweight Playwright starter project using Python, focused on clarity, maintainability, and realistic QA workflows.

## Why this exists

This repository is intended as a clean starting point for QA engineers who want to use Playwright with Python without unnecessary abstraction or boilerplate.

The structure prioritises:
- Readable test code
- Simple configuration
- Clear separation between tests and helpers
- Patterns that scale without becoming complex

## What is included

- Playwright configured with Python
- Example tests and page interactions
- Basic project structure suitable for small and medium test suites
- A foundation that can be extended with fixtures, rules, or AI assisted workflows

## What this is not

- A full test framework
- A demo of every Playwright feature
- A replacement for good test design

## Who this is for

- QA engineers getting started with Playwright and Python
- Testers who value simplicity over heavy frameworks
- Teams looking for a clean base to build from

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies
2. Run the example tests
3. Adapt the structure to your own needs

This project is intentionally small. It is meant to be shaped, not adopted as is.
